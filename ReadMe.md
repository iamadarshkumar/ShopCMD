	Make this your default program for opening text files.(This will help in opening the correct format of your shopping Bill).
	
**Please follow these steps carefully to Run the program:**


			
1. Make sure you have the jdk 1.8, mySQLserver and the mySQL connector driver installed on your system and configured properly.
2. Extract all the files in a folder.
3. Next, compile and run "createDatabase.java", This will create the database if it does not exist and fill the table initials.
4. Finally, compile the program "Cart.java" and follow the GUIDELINES there.
